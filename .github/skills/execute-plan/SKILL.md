description: Execute a phase prompt (PLAN.md) and create the outcome summary (SUMMARY.md). Handles task execution with proper git integration.
---

<purpose>
Execute a phase prompt (PLAN.md) and create the outcome summary (SUMMARY.md).
</purpose>

<required_reading>
Read STATE.md before any operation to load project context.
Read config.json for planning behavior settings.

../../instructions/git-integration.instructions.md
</required_reading>

<process>

<step name="resolve_model_profile" priority="first">
Read model profile for agent spawning:

```bash
MODEL_PROFILE=$(cat .gsd/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"model_profile"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | grep -o '"[^"]*"$' | tr -d '"' || echo "balanced")
```

Default to "balanced" if not set.

**Model lookup table:**

| Agent        | quality | balanced | budget |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | ------ |
| gsd-executor | opus    | sonnet   | sonnet |

Store resolved model for use in Task calls below.
</step>

<step name="load_project_state">
Before any operation, read project state:

```bash
cat .gsd/STATE.md 2>/dev/null
```

**If file exists:** Parse and internalize:

- Current position (phase, plan, status)
- Accumulated decisions (constraints on this execution)
- Blockers/concerns (things to watch for)
- Brief alignment status

**If file missing but .gsd/ exists:**

```
STATE.md missing but planning artifacts exist.
Options:
1. Reconstruct from existing artifacts
2. Continue without project state (may lose accumulated context)
```

**If .gsd/ doesn't exist:** Error - project not initialized.

This ensures every execution has full project context.

**Load planning config:**

```bash
# Check if planning docs should be committed (default: true)
COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=$(cat .gsd/config.json 2>/dev/null | grep -o '"commit_docs"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[^,}]*' | grep -o 'true\|false' || echo "true")
# Auto-detect gitignored (overrides config)
git check-ignore -q .gsd 2>/dev/null && COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS=false
```

Store `COMMIT_PLANNING_DOCS` for use in git operations.
</step>

<step name="identify_plan">
Find the next plan to execute:
- Check roadmap for "In progress" phase
- Find plans in that phase directory
- Identify first plan without corresponding SUMMARY

```bash
cat .gsd/ROADMAP.md
# Look for phase with "In progress" status
# Then find plans in that phase
ls .gsd/phases/XX-name/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | sort
ls .gsd/phases/XX-name/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort
```

**Logic:**

- If `01-01-PLAN.md` exists but `01-01-SUMMARY.md` doesn't → execute 01-01
- If `01-01-SUMMARY.md` exists but `01-02-SUMMARY.md` doesn't → execute 01-02
- Pattern: Find first PLAN file without matching SUMMARY file

**Decimal phase handling:**

Phase directories can be integer or decimal format:

- Integer: `.gsd/phases/01-foundation/01-01-PLAN.md`
- Decimal: `.gsd/phases/01.1-hotfix/01.1-01-PLAN.md`

Parse phase number from path (handles both formats):

```bash
# Extract phase number (handles XX or XX.Y format)
PHASE=$(echo "$PLAN_PATH" | grep -oE '[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?-[0-9]+')
```

SUMMARY naming follows same pattern:

- Integer: `01-01-SUMMARY.md`
- Decimal: `01.1-01-SUMMARY.md`

Confirm with user if ambiguous.

<config-check>
```bash
cat .gsd/config.json 2>/dev/null

</step>

<step name="parse_segments">
**Intelligent segmentation: Parse plan into execution segments.**

Plans are divided into segments by checkpoints. Each segment is routed to optimal execution context (subagent or main).

**1. Check for checkpoints:**

```bash
# Find all checkpoints and their types
grep -n "type=\"checkpoint" .gsd/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
```

**2. Analyze execution strategy:**

**If NO checkpoints found:**

- **Fully autonomous plan** - spawn single subagent for entire plan
- Subagent gets fresh 200k context, executes all tasks, creates SUMMARY, commits
- Main context: Just orchestration (~5% usage)

**If checkpoints found, parse into segments:**

Segment = tasks between checkpoints (or start→first checkpoint, or last checkpoint→end)

**For each segment, determine routing:**

```
Segment routing rules:

IF segment has no prior checkpoint:
  → SUBAGENT (first segment, nothing to depend on)

IF segment follows checkpoint:human-verify:
  → SUBAGENT (verification is just confirmation, doesn't affect next work)

IF segment follows checkpoint:decision OR checkpoint:human-action:
  → MAIN CONTEXT (next tasks need the decision/result)
```

**3. Execution pattern:**

**Pattern A: Fully autonomous (no checkpoints)**

```
Spawn subagent → execute all tasks → SUMMARY → commit → report back
```

**Pattern B: Segmented with verify-only checkpoints**

```
Segment 1 (tasks 1-3): Spawn subagent → execute → report back
Checkpoint 4 (human-verify): Main context → you verify → continue
Segment 2 (tasks 5-6): Spawn NEW subagent → execute → report back
Checkpoint 7 (human-verify): Main context → you verify → continue
Aggregate results → SUMMARY → commit
```

**Pattern C: Decision-dependent (must stay in main)**

```
Checkpoint 1 (decision): Main context → you decide → continue in main
Tasks 2-5: Main context (need decision from checkpoint 1)
No segmentation benefit - execute entirely in main
```

**4. Why segment:** Fresh context per subagent preserves peak quality. Main context stays lean (~15% usage).

**5. Implementation:**

**For fully autonomous plans:**

```
1. Run init_agent_tracking step first (see step below)

2. Use Task tool with subagent_type="gsd-executor" and model="{executor_model}":

   Prompt: "Execute plan at .gsd/phases/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md

   This is an autonomous plan (no checkpoints). Execute all tasks, create SUMMARY.md in phase directory, commit with message following plan's commit guidance.

   Follow all deviation rules and authentication gate protocols from the plan.

   When complete, report: plan name, tasks completed, SUMMARY path, commit hash."

3. After Task tool returns with agent_id:

   a. Write agent_id to current-agent-id.txt:
      echo "[agent_id]" > .gsd/current-agent-id.txt

   b. Append spawn entry to agent-history.json:
      {
        "agent_id": "[agent_id from Task response]",
        "task_description": "Execute full plan {phase}-{plan} (autonomous)",
        "phase": "{phase}",
        "plan": "{plan}",
        "segment": null,
        "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]",
        "status": "spawned",
        "completion_timestamp": null
      }

4. Wait for subagent to complete

5. After subagent completes successfully:

   a. Update agent-history.json entry:
      - Find entry with matching agent_id
      - Set status: "completed"
      - Set completion_timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]"

   b. Clear current-agent-id.txt:
      rm .gsd/current-agent-id.txt

6. Report completion to user
```

**For segmented plans (has verify-only checkpoints):**

```
Execute segment-by-segment:

For each autonomous segment:
  Spawn subagent with prompt: "Execute tasks [X-Y] from plan at .gsd/phases/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md. Read the plan for full context and deviation rules. Do NOT create SUMMARY or commit - just execute these tasks and report results."

  Wait for subagent completion

For each checkpoint:
  Execute in main context
  Wait for user interaction
  Continue to next segment

After all segments complete:
  Aggregate all results
  Create SUMMARY.md
  Commit with all changes
```

**For decision-dependent plans:**

```
Execute in main context (standard flow below)
No subagent routing
Quality maintained through small scope (2-3 tasks per plan)
```

See step name="segment_execution" for detailed segment execution loop.
</step>

<step name="init_agent_tracking">
**Initialize agent tracking for subagent resume capability.**

Before spawning any subagents, set up tracking infrastructure:

**1. Create/verify tracking files:**

```bash
# Create agent history file if doesn't exist
if [ ! -f .gsd/agent-history.json ]; then
  echo '{"version":"1.0","max_entries":50,"entries":[]}' > .gsd/agent-history.json
fi

# Clear any stale current-agent-id (from interrupted sessions)
# Will be populated when subagent spawns
rm -f .gsd/current-agent-id.txt
```

**2. Check for interrupted agents (resume detection):**

```bash
# Check if current-agent-id.txt exists from previous interrupted session
if [ -f .gsd/current-agent-id.txt ]; then
  INTERRUPTED_ID=$(cat .gsd/current-agent-id.txt)
  echo "Found interrupted agent: $INTERRUPTED_ID"
fi
```

**If interrupted agent found:**

- The agent ID file exists from a previous session that didn't complete
- This agent can potentially be resumed using Task tool's `resume` parameter
- Present to user: "Previous session was interrupted. Resume agent [ID] or start fresh?"
- If resume: Use Task tool with `resume` parameter set to the interrupted ID
- If fresh: Clear the file and proceed normally

**3. Prune old entries (housekeeping):**

If agent-history.json has more than `max_entries`:

- Remove oldest entries with status "completed"
- Never remove entries with status "spawned" (may need resume)
- Keep file under size limit for fast reads

**When to run this step:**

- Pattern A (fully autonomous): Before spawning the single subagent
- Pattern B (segmented): Before the segment execution loop
- Pattern C (main context): Skip - no subagents spawned
  </step>

<step name="segment_execution">
**Detailed segment execution loop for segmented plans.**

**This step applies ONLY to segmented plans (Pattern B: has checkpoints, but they're verify-only).**

For Pattern A (fully autonomous) and Pattern C (decision-dependent), skip this step.

**Execution flow:**

````
1. Parse plan to identify segments:
   - Read plan file
   - Find checkpoint locations: grep -n "type=\"checkpoint" PLAN.md
   - Identify checkpoint types: grep "type=\"checkpoint" PLAN.md | grep -o 'checkpoint:[^"]*'
   - Build segment map:
     * Segment 1: Start → first checkpoint (tasks 1-X)
     * Checkpoint 1: Type and location
     * Segment 2: After checkpoint 1 → next checkpoint (tasks X+1 to Y)
     * Checkpoint 2: Type and location
     * ... continue for all segments

2. For each segment in order:

   A. Determine routing (apply rules from parse_segments):
      - No prior checkpoint? → Subagent
      - Prior checkpoint was human-verify? → Subagent
      - Prior checkpoint was decision/human-action? → Main context

   B. If routing = Subagent:
      ```
      Spawn Task tool with subagent_type="gsd-executor" and model="{executor_model}":

      Prompt: "Execute tasks [task numbers/names] from plan at [plan path].

      **Context:**
      - Read the full plan for objective, context files, and deviation rules
      - You are executing a SEGMENT of this plan (not the full plan)
      - Other segments will be executed separately

      **Your responsibilities:**
      - Execute only the tasks assigned to you
      - Follow all deviation rules and authentication gate protocols
      - Track deviations for later Summary
      - DO NOT create SUMMARY.md (will be created after all segments complete)
      - DO NOT commit (will be done after all segments complete)

      **Report back:**
      - Tasks completed
      - Files created/modified
      - Deviations encountered
      - Any issues or blockers"

      **After Task tool returns with agent_id:**

      1. Write agent_id to current-agent-id.txt:
         echo "[agent_id]" > .gsd/current-agent-id.txt

      2. Append spawn entry to agent-history.json:
         {
           "agent_id": "[agent_id from Task response]",
           "task_description": "Execute tasks [X-Y] from plan {phase}-{plan}",
           "phase": "{phase}",
           "plan": "{plan}",
           "segment": [segment_number],
           "timestamp": "[ISO timestamp]",
           "status": "spawned",
           "completion_timestamp": null
         }

      Wait for subagent to complete
      Capture results (files changed, deviations, etc.)

      **After subagent completes successfully:**

      1. Update agent-history.json entry:
         - Find entry with matching agent_id
         - Set status: "completed"
         - Set completion_timestamp: "[ISO timestamp]"

      2. Clear current-agent-id.txt:
         rm .gsd/current-agent-id.txt

      ```

   C. If routing = Main context:
      Execute tasks in main using standard execution flow (step name="execute")
      Track results locally

   D. After segment completes (whether subagent or main):
      Continue to next checkpoint/segment

3. After ALL segments complete:

   A. Aggregate results from all segments:
      - Collect files created/modified from all segments
      - Collect deviations from all segments
      - Collect decisions from all checkpoints
      - Merge into complete picture

   B. Create SUMMARY.md:
      - Use aggregated results
      - Document all work from all segments
      - Include deviations from all segments
      - Note which segments were subagented

   C. Commit:
      - Stage all files from all segments
      - Stage SUMMARY.md
      - Commit with message following plan guidance
      - Include note about segmented execution if relevant

   D. Report completion

**Example execution trace:**

````

**Benefit:** Each subagent starts fresh (~20-30% context), enabling larger plans without quality degradation.
</step>

<step name="load_prompt">
Read the plan prompt:
```bash
cat .gsd/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md
````

This IS the execution instructions. Follow it exactly.

**If plan references CONTEXT.md:**
The CONTEXT.md file provides the user's vision for this phase — how they imagine it working, what's essential, and what's out of scope. Honor this context throughout execution.
</step>

<step name="previous_phase_check">
Before executing, check if previous phase had issues:

```bash
# Find previous phase summary
ls .gsd/phases/*/SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | sort -r | head -2 | tail -1
```

If previous phase SUMMARY.md has "Issues Encountered" != "None" or "Next Phase Readiness" mentions blockers:

Use HumanAgent MCP (HumanAgent_Chat):

- header: "Previous Issues"
- question: "Previous phase had unresolved items: [summary]. How to proceed?"
- options:
  - "Proceed anyway" - Issues won't block this phase
  - "Address first" - Let's resolve before continuing
  - "Review previous" - Show me the full summary
    </step>

<step name="execute">
Execute each task in the prompt. **Deviations are normal** - handle them automatically using embedded rules below.

1. Read the @context files listed in the prompt

2. For each task:

   **If `type="auto"`:**

   **Before executing:** Check if task has `tdd="true"` attribute:
   - If yes: Follow TDD execution flow (see `<tdd_execution>`) - RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle with atomic commits per stage
   - If no: Standard implementation

   - Work toward task completion
   - **If CLI/API returns authentication error:** Handle as authentication gate (see below)
   - **When you discover additional work not in plan:** Apply deviation rules (see below) automatically
   - Continue implementing, applying rules as needed
   - Run the verification
   - Confirm done criteria met
   - **Commit the task** (see `<task_commit>` below)
   - Track task completion and commit hash for Summary documentation
   - Continue to next task

   **If `type="checkpoint:*"`:**
   - STOP immediately (do not continue to next task)
   - Execute checkpoint_protocol (see below)
   - Wait for user response
   - Verify if possible (check files, env vars, etc.)
   - Only after user confirmation: continue to next task

3. Run overall verification checks from `<verification>` section
4. Confirm all success criteria from `<success_criteria>` section met
5. Document all deviations in Summary (automatic - see deviation_documentation below)
   </step>

<authentication_gates>

## Handling Authentication Errors During Execution

**When you encounter authentication errors during `type="auto"` task execution:**

This is NOT a failure. Authentication gates are expected and normal. Handle them dynamically:

**Authentication error indicators:**

- CLI returns: "Error: Not authenticated", "Not logged in", "Unauthorized", "401", "403"
- API returns: "Authentication required", "Invalid API key", "Missing credentials"
- Command fails with: "Please run {tool} login" or "Set {ENV_VAR} environment variable"

**Authentication gate protocol:**

1. **Recognize it's an auth gate** - Not a bug, just needs credentials
2. **STOP current task execution** - Don't retry repeatedly
3. **Create dynamic checkpoint:human-action** - Present it to user immediately
4. **Provide exact authentication steps** - CLI commands, where to get keys
5. **Wait for user to authenticate** - Let them complete auth flow
6. **Verify authentication works** - Test that credentials are valid
7. **Retry the original task** - Resume automation where you left off
8. **Continue normally** - Don't treat this as an error in Summary

**Example: Vercel deployment hits auth error**

```
Task 3: Deploy to Vercel
Running: vercel --yes

Error: Not authenticated. Please run 'vercel login'

[Create checkpoint dynamically]

```

**In Summary documentation:**

Document authentication gates as normal flow, not deviations:

```markdown
## Authentication Gates

During execution, I encountered authentication requirements:

1. Task 3: Vercel CLI required authentication
   - Paused for `vercel login`
   - Resumed after authentication
   - Deployed successfully

These are normal gates, not errors.
```

**Key principles:**

- Authentication gates are NOT failures or bugs
- They're expected interaction points during first-time setup
- Handle them gracefully and continue automation after unblocked
- Don't mark tasks as "failed" or "incomplete" due to auth gates
- Document them as normal flow, separate from deviations
  </authentication_gates>

<deviation_rules>

## Automatic Deviation Handling

**While executing tasks, you WILL discover work not in the plan.** This is normal.

Apply these rules automatically. Track all deviations for Summary documentation.

---

**RULE 1: Auto-fix bugs**

**Trigger:** Code doesn't work as intended (broken behavior, incorrect output, errors)

**Action:** Fix immediately, track for Summary

**Examples:**

- Wrong SQL query returning incorrect data
- Logic errors (inverted condition, off-by-one, infinite loop)
- Type errors, null pointer exceptions, undefined references
- Broken validation (accepts invalid input, rejects valid input)
- Security vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure auth)
- Race conditions, deadlocks
- Memory leaks, resource leaks

**Process:**

1. Fix the bug inline
2. Add/update tests to prevent regression
3. Verify fix works
4. Continue task
5. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 1 - Bug] [description]`

**No user permission needed.** Bugs must be fixed for correct operation.

---

**RULE 2: Auto-add missing critical functionality**

**Trigger:** Code is missing essential features for correctness, security, or basic operation

**Action:** Add immediately, track for Summary

**Examples:**

- Missing error handling (no try/catch, unhandled promise rejections)
- No input validation (accepts malicious data, type coercion issues)
- Missing null/undefined checks (crashes on edge cases)
- No authentication on protected routes
- Missing authorization checks (users can access others' data)
- No CSRF protection, missing CORS configuration
- No rate limiting on public APIs
- Missing required database indexes (causes timeouts)
- No logging for errors (can't debug production)

**Process:**

1. Add the missing functionality inline
2. Add tests for the new functionality
3. Verify it works
4. Continue task
5. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 2 - Missing Critical] [description]`

**Critical = required for correct/secure/performant operation**
**No user permission needed.** These are not "features" - they're requirements for basic correctness.

---

**RULE 3: Auto-fix blocking issues**

**Trigger:** Something prevents you from completing current task

**Action:** Fix immediately to unblock, track for Summary

**Examples:**

- Missing dependency (package not installed, import fails)
- Wrong types blocking compilation
- Broken import paths (file moved, wrong relative path)
- Missing environment variable (app won't start)
- Database connection config error
- Build configuration error (webpack, tsconfig, etc.)
- Missing file referenced in code
- Circular dependency blocking module resolution

**Process:**

1. Fix the blocking issue
2. Verify task can now proceed
3. Continue task
4. Track in deviations list: `[Rule 3 - Blocking] [description]`

**No user permission needed.** Can't complete task without fixing blocker.

---

**RULE 4: Ask about architectural changes**

**Trigger:** Fix/addition requires significant structural modification

**Action:** STOP, present to user, wait for decision

**Examples:**

- Adding new database table (not just column)
- Major schema changes (changing primary key, splitting tables)
- Introducing new service layer or architectural pattern
- Switching libraries/frameworks (React → Vue, REST → GraphQL)
- Changing authentication approach (sessions → JWT)
- Adding new infrastructure (message queue, cache layer, CDN)
- Changing API contracts (breaking changes to endpoints)
- Adding new deployment environment

**Process:**

1. STOP current task
2. Present clearly:

```
⚠️ Architectural Decision Needed

Current task: [task name]
Discovery: [what you found that prompted this]
Proposed change: [architectural modification]
Why needed: [rationale]
Impact: [what this affects - APIs, deployment, dependencies, etc.]
Alternatives: [other approaches, or "none apparent"]

Proceed with proposed change? (yes / different approach / defer)
```

3. WAIT for user response
4. If approved: implement, track as `[Rule 4 - Architectural] [description]`
5. If different approach: discuss and implement
6. If deferred: note in Summary and continue without change

**User decision required.** These changes affect system design.

---

**RULE PRIORITY (when multiple could apply):**

1. **If Rule 4 applies** → STOP and ask (architectural decision)
2. **If Rules 1-3 apply** → Fix automatically, track for Summary
3. **If genuinely unsure which rule** → Apply Rule 4 (ask user)

**Edge case guidance:**

- "This validation is missing" → Rule 2 (critical for security)
- "This crashes on null" → Rule 1 (bug)
- "Need to add table" → Rule 4 (architectural)
- "Need to add column" → Rule 1 or 2 (depends: fixing bug or adding critical field)

**When in doubt:** Ask yourself "Does this affect correctness, security, or ability to complete task?"

- YES → Rules 1-3 (fix automatically)
- MAYBE → Rule 4 (ask user)

</deviation_rules>

<deviation_documentation>

## Documenting Deviations in Summary

After all tasks complete, Summary MUST include deviations section.

**If no deviations:**

```markdown
## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.
```

**If deviations occurred:**

```markdown
## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed case-sensitive email uniqueness constraint**

- **Found during:** Task 4 (Follow/unfollow API implementation)
- **Issue:** User.email unique constraint was case-sensitive - Test@example.com and test@example.com were both allowed, causing duplicate accounts
- **Fix:** Changed to `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX users_email_unique ON users (LOWER(email))`
- **Files modified:** src/models/User.ts, migrations/003_fix_email_unique.sql
- **Verification:** Unique constraint test passes - duplicate emails properly rejected
- **Commit:** abc123f

**2. [Rule 2 - Missing Critical] Added JWT expiry validation to auth middleware**

- **Found during:** Task 3 (Protected route implementation)
- **Issue:** Auth middleware wasn't checking token expiry - expired tokens were being accepted
- **Fix:** Added exp claim validation in middleware, reject with 401 if expired
- **Files modified:** src/middleware/auth.ts, src/middleware/auth.test.ts
- **Verification:** Expired token test passes - properly rejects with 401
- **Commit:** def456g

---

**Total deviations:** 4 auto-fixed (1 bug, 1 missing critical, 1 blocking, 1 architectural with approval)
**Impact on plan:** All auto-fixes necessary for correctness/security/performance. No scope creep.

## TDD Plan Execution

When executing a plan with `type: tdd` in frontmatter, follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle for the single feature defined in the plan.

**1. Check test infrastructure (if first TDD plan):**
If no test framework configured:

- Detect project type from package.json/requirements.txt/etc.
- Install minimal test framework (Jest, pytest, Go testing, etc.)
- Create test config file
- Verify: run empty test suite
- This is part of the RED phase, not a separate task

**2. RED - Write failing test:**

- Read `<behavior>` element for test specification
- Create test file if doesn't exist (follow project conventions)
- Write test(s) that describe expected behavior
- Run tests - MUST fail (if passes, test is wrong or feature exists)
- Commit: `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for [feature]`

**3. GREEN - Implement to pass:**

- Read `<implementation>` element for guidance
- Write minimal code to make test pass
- Run tests - MUST pass
- Commit: `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement [feature]`

**4. REFACTOR (if needed):**

- Clean up code if obvious improvements
- Run tests - MUST still pass
- Commit only if changes made: `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up [feature]`

**Commit pattern for TDD plans:**
Each TDD plan produces 2-3 atomic commits:

1. `test({phase}-{plan}): add failing test for X`
2. `feat({phase}-{plan}): implement X`
3. `refactor({phase}-{plan}): clean up X` (optional)

**Error handling:**

- If test doesn't fail in RED phase: Test is wrong or feature already exists. Investigate before proceeding.
- If test doesn't pass in GREEN phase: Debug implementation, keep iterating until green.
- If tests fail in REFACTOR phase: Undo refactor, commit was premature.

**Verification:**
After TDD plan completion, ensure:

- All tests pass
- Test coverage for the new behavior exists
- No unrelated tests broken

**Why TDD uses dedicated plans:** TDD requires 2-3 execution cycles (RED → GREEN → REFACTOR), each with file reads, test runs, and potential debugging. This consumes 40-50% of context for a single feature. Dedicated plans ensure full quality throughout the cycle.

**Comparison:**

- Standard plans: Multiple tasks, 1 commit per task, 2-4 commits total
- TDD plans: Single feature, 2-3 commits for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle

See `../../instructions/tdd.instructions.md` for TDD plan structure.
</tdd_plan_execution>

<task_commit>

## Task Commit Protocol

After each task completes (verification passed, done criteria met), commit immediately:

**1. Identify modified files:**

Track files changed during this specific task (not the entire plan):

```bash
git status --short
```

**2. Stage only task-related files:**

Stage each file individually (NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`):

```bash
# Example - adjust to actual files modified by this task
git add src/api/auth.ts
git add src/types/user.ts
```

**3. Determine commit type:**

| Type       | When to Use                                           | Example                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New feature, endpoint, component, functionality       | feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint     |
| `fix`      | Bug fix, error correction                             | fix(08-02): correct email validation regex         |
| `test`     | Test-only changes (TDD RED phase)                     | test(08-02): add failing test for password hashing |
| `refactor` | Code cleanup, no behavior change (TDD REFACTOR phase) | refactor(08-02): extract validation to helper      |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                               | perf(08-02): add database index for user lookups   |
| `docs`     | Documentation changes                                 | docs(08-02): add API endpoint documentation        |
| `style`    | Formatting, linting fixes                             | style(08-02): format auth module                   |
| `chore`    | Config, tooling, dependencies                         | chore(08-02): add bcrypt dependency                |

**4. Craft commit message:**

Format: `{type}({phase}-{plan}): {task-name-or-description}`

```bash
git commit -m "{type}({phase}-{plan}): {concise task description}

- {key change 1}
- {key change 2}
- {key change 3}
"
```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Standard plan task
git commit -m "feat(08-02): create user registration endpoint

- POST /auth/register validates email and password
- Checks for duplicate users
- Returns JWT token on success
"

# Another standard task
git commit -m "fix(08-02): correct email validation regex

- Fixed regex to accept plus-addressing
- Added tests for edge cases
"
```

**Note:** TDD plans have their own commit pattern (test/feat/refactor for RED/GREEN/REFACTOR phases). See `<tdd_plan_execution>` section above.

**5. Record commit hash:**

After committing, capture hash for SUMMARY.md:

```bash
TASK_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)
echo "Task ${TASK_NUM} committed: ${TASK_COMMIT}"
```

Store in array or list for SUMMARY generation:

```bash
TASK_COMMITS+=("Task ${TASK_NUM}: ${TASK_COMMIT}")
```

</task_commit>

<step name="checkpoint_protocol">
When encountering `type="checkpoint:*"`:

**Critical: Copilot automates everything with CLI/API before checkpoints.** Checkpoints are for verification and decisions, not manual work.

**Display checkpoint clearly:**

```

**After displaying:** WAIT for user response. Do NOT hallucinate completion. Do NOT continue to next task.

**After user responds:**

- Run verification if specified (file exists, env var set, tests pass, etc.)
- If verification passes or N/A: continue to next task
- If verification fails: inform user, wait for resolution

See ../../instructions/checkpoints.instructions.md for complete checkpoint guidance.
</step>

<step name="checkpoint_return_for_orchestrator">
**When spawned by an orchestrator (execute-phase or execute-plan command):**

If you were spawned via Task tool and hit a checkpoint, you cannot directly interact with the user. Instead, RETURN to the orchestrator with structured checkpoint state so it can present to the user and spawn a fresh continuation agent.

**Return format for checkpoints:**

**Required in your return:**

1. **Completed Tasks table** - Tasks done so far with commit hashes and files created
2. **Current Task** - Which task you're on and what's blocking it
3. **Checkpoint Details** - User-facing content (verification steps, decision options, or action instructions)
4. **Awaiting** - What you need from the user

**Example return:**

```
## CHECKPOINT REACHED

**Type:** human-action
**Plan:** 01-01
**Progress:** 1/3 tasks complete

### Completed Tasks

| Task | Name | Commit | Files |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Initialize Next.js 15 project | d6fe73f | package.json, tsconfig.json, app/ |

### Current Task

**Task 2:** Initialize Convex backend
**Status:** blocked
**Blocked by:** Convex CLI authentication required

### Checkpoint Details

**Automation attempted:**
Ran `npx convex dev` to initialize Convex backend

**Error encountered:**
"Error: Not authenticated. Run `npx convex login` first."

**What you need to do:**
1. Run: `npx convex login`
2. Complete browser authentication
3. Run: `npx convex dev`
4. Create project when prompted

**I'll verify after:**
`cat .env.local | grep CONVEX` returns the Convex URL

### Awaiting

Type "done" when Convex is authenticated and project created.
```

**After you return:**

The orchestrator will:

1. Parse your structured return
2. Present checkpoint details to the user
3. Collect user's response
4. Spawn a FRESH continuation agent with your completed tasks state

You will NOT be resumed. A new agent continues from where you stopped, using your Completed Tasks table to know what's done.

**How to know if you were spawned:**

If you're reading this workflow because an orchestrator spawned you (vs running directly), the orchestrator's prompt will include checkpoint return instructions. Follow those instructions when you hit a checkpoint.

**If running in main context (not spawned):**

Use the standard checkpoint_protocol - display checkpoint and wait for direct user response.

<step name="verification_failure_gate">
If any task verification fails:

STOP. Do not continue to next task.

Present inline:
"Verification failed for Task [X]: [task name]

<step name="generate_user_setup">
**Generate USER-SETUP.md if plan has user_setup in frontmatter.**

Check PLAN.md frontmatter for `user_setup` field:

```bash
grep -A 50 "^user_setup:" .gsd/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md | head -50
```

**If user_setup exists and is not empty:**

Create `.gsd/phases/XX-name/{phase}-USER-SETUP.md` using template from `~/.gsd/templates/user-setup.md`.

**Content generation:**

1. Parse each service in `user_setup` array
2. For each service, generate sections:
   - Environment Variables table (from `env_vars`)
   - Account Setup checklist (from `account_setup`, if present)
   - Dashboard Configuration steps (from `dashboard_config`, if present)
   - Local Development notes (from `local_dev`, if present)
3. Add verification section with commands to confirm setup works
4. Set status to "Incomplete"

**Example output:**

```markdown

**If user_setup is empty or missing:**

Skip this step - no USER-SETUP.md needed.

**Track for offer_next:**

Set `USER_SETUP_CREATED=true` if file was generated, for use in completion messaging.
</step>

<step name="create_summary">
Create `{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md` as specified in the prompt's `<output>` section.
Use ~/.gsd/templates/summary.md for structure.

**File location:** `.gsd/phases/XX-name/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md`

**Frontmatter population:**

Before writing summary content, populate frontmatter fields from execution context:

1. **Basic identification:**
   - phase: From PLAN.md frontmatter
   - plan: From PLAN.md frontmatter
   - subsystem: Categorize based on phase focus (auth, payments, ui, api, database, infra, testing, etc.)
   - tags: Extract tech keywords (libraries, frameworks, tools used)

2. **Dependency graph:**
   - requires: List prior phases this built upon (check PLAN.md context section for referenced prior summaries)
   - provides: Extract from accomplishments - what was delivered
   - affects: Infer from phase description/goal what future phases might need this

3. **Tech tracking:**
   - tech-stack.added: New libraries from package.json changes or requirements
   - tech-stack.patterns: Architectural patterns established (from decisions/accomplishments)

4. **File tracking:**
   - key-files.created: From "Files Created/Modified" section
   - key-files.modified: From "Files Created/Modified" section

5. **Decisions:**
   - key-decisions: Extract from "Decisions Made" section

6. **Metrics:**
   - duration: From $DURATION variable
   - completed: From $PLAN_END_TIME (date only, format YYYY-MM-DD)

Note: If subsystem/affects are unclear, use best judgment based on phase name and accomplishments. Can be refined later.

**Title format:** `# Phase [X] Plan [Y]: [Name] Summary`

The one-liner must be SUBSTANTIVE:

- Good: "JWT auth with refresh rotation using jose library"
- Bad: "Authentication implemented"

**Include performance data:**

- Duration: `$DURATION`
- Started: `$PLAN_START_TIME`
- Completed: `$PLAN_END_TIME`
- Tasks completed: (count from execution)
- Files modified: (count from execution)

**Next Step section:**

- If more plans exist in this phase: "Ready for {phase}-{next-plan}-PLAN.md"
- If this is the last plan: "Phase complete, ready for transition"

```markdown
Phase: [current] of [total] ([phase name])
Plan: [just completed] of [total in phase]
Status: [In progress / Phase complete]
Last activity: [today] - Completed {phase}-{plan}-PLAN.md

Progress: [progress bar]
```

**Calculate progress bar:**

- Count total plans across all phases (from ROADMAP.md or ROADMAP.md)
- Count completed plans (count SUMMARY.md files that exist)
- Progress = (completed / total) × 100%
- Render: ░ for incomplete, █ for complete

**Example - completing 02-01-PLAN.md (plan 5 of 10 total):**

Before:

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Authentication)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2025-01-18 - Phase 1 complete

Progress: ██████░░░░ 40%

```markdown
## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 4 (Authentication)
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2025-01-19 - Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: ███████░░░ 50%
```

**Step complete when:**

- [ ] Phase number shows current phase (X of total)
- [ ] Plan number shows plans complete in current phase (N of total-in-phase)
- [ ] Status reflects current state (In progress / Phase complete)

**If .gsd/codebase/ doesn't exist:**
Skip this step.
</step>

<step name="offer_next">
**MANDATORY: Verify remaining work before presenting next steps.**

Do NOT skip this verification. Do NOT assume phase or milestone completion without checking.

**Step 0: Check for USER-SETUP.md**

If `USER_SETUP_CREATED=true` (from generate_user_setup step), always include this warning block at the TOP of completion output:

```
⚠️ USER SETUP REQUIRED

This phase introduced external services requiring manual configuration:

📋 .gsd/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-USER-SETUP.md

Quick view:
- [ ] {ENV_VAR_1}
- [ ] {ENV_VAR_2}
- [ ] {Dashboard config task}

Complete this setup for the integration to function.
Run `cat .gsd/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-USER-SETUP.md` for full details.

---
```

This warning appears BEFORE "Plan complete" messaging. User sees setup requirements prominently.

**Step 1: Count plans and summaries in current phase**

List files in the phase directory:

```bash
ls -1 .gsd/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-PLAN.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
ls -1 .gsd/phases/[current-phase-dir]/*-SUMMARY.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l
```

State the counts: "This phase has [X] plans and [Y] summaries."

**Step 2: Route based on plan completion**

Compare the counts from Step 1:

| Condition         | Meaning           | Action            |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| summaries < plans | More plans remain | Go to **Route A** |
| summaries = plans | Phase complete    | Go to Step 3      |

---

**Route A: More plans remain in this phase**

Identify the next unexecuted plan:

- Find the first PLAN.md file that has no matching SUMMARY.md
- Read its `<objective>` section

<if mode="yolo">
```
Plan {phase}-{plan} complete.
Summary: .gsd/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md

{Y} of {X} plans complete for Phase {Z}.

⚡ Auto-continuing: Execute next plan ({phase}-{next-plan})

```

Loop back to identify_plan step automatically.
</if>

<if mode="interactive" OR="custom with gates.execute_next_plan true">
```

Plan {phase}-{plan} complete.
Summary: .gsd/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md

{Y} of {X} plans complete for Phase {Z}.

## ▶ Next Up

**{phase}-{next-plan}: [Plan Name]** — [objective from next PLAN.md]

**Also available:**

- `/verify-work.md {phase}-{plan}` — manual acceptance testing before continuing
- Review what was built before continuing

---

```

Wait for user to clear and run next command.
</if>

**STOP here if Route A applies. Do not continue to Step 3.**

---

**Step 3: Check milestone status (only when all plans in phase are complete)**

Read ROADMAP.md and extract:
1. Current phase number (from the plan just completed)
2. All phase numbers listed in the current milestone section

To find phases in the current milestone, look for:
- Phase headers: lines starting with `### Phase` or `#### Phase`
- Phase list items: lines like `- [ ] **Phase X:` or `- [x] **Phase X:`

Count total phases in the current milestone and identify the highest phase number.

State: "Current phase is {X}. Milestone has {N} phases (highest: {Y})."

**Step 4: Route based on milestone status**

| Condition | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| current phase < highest phase | More phases remain | Go to **Route B** |
| current phase = highest phase | Milestone complete | Go to **Route C** |

---

**Route B: Phase complete, more phases remain in milestone**

Read ROADMAP.md to get the next phase's name and goal.

```

Plan {phase}-{plan} complete.
Summary: .gsd/phases/{phase-dir}/{phase}-{plan}-SUMMARY.md

## ✓ Phase {Z}: {Phase Name} Complete
