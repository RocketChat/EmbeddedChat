### Integration

To apply your custom theme:

```jsx
<EmbeddedChat
  // ...other props
  theme={myCustomTheme}
/>
```

Alternatively, you can paste the theme object into the Theme settings of the EmbeddedChat RC App. Note: These settings will only take effect if the `remoteOpt` prop is set to `true` when configuring EmbeddedChat.
