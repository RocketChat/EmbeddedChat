An easy-to-use, full-stack component (React.js + backend behaviors) for embedding Rocket.Chat into your web app.

_EmbeddedChat is a full-stack React component designed to integrate Rocket.Chat into your web app. It is fully configurable, extensible, and flexible, offering various preconfigured designs, multiple login options, and more. The component is tightly integrated with the Rocket.Chat server using the Rocket.Chat SDK, and its entire UI is built using custom components._

- **Password:** test_acc

## Installation and Usage

Installation and usage documentation could be found here [EmbeddedChat installation and usage](https://rocketchat.github.io/EmbeddedChat/docs/docs/Usage/embeddedchat_setup)

## Development

### Local Setup

To develop and test `EmbeddedChat`, you need a local instance of the Rocket.Chat server. Follow the guide in the [Rocket.Chat Developer Docs](https://developer.rocket.chat/v1/docs/server-environment-setup) for setting up a Rocket.Chat development environment.

Ensure that the "Enable CORS" option is turned on in your Rocket.Chat server. You can find it under Administration > Settings > General > REST API > Enable CORS. This setting must be enabled to access the app's functionality.

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 16.19.0 is required. Use [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for easy switching between Node.js versions.

  To install and use the correct Node.js version, execute the following commands with the specific version number:

  ```bash
  nvm install <version>
  nvm use <version>
  ```

  Replace `<version>` with the required Node.js version

- **Yarn Workspaces**: Ensure Yarn workspaces are enabled. If not, run:

  ```bash
  corepack enable
  ```

#### Install Dependencies

Install all necessary dependencies by navigating to the root directory of `EmbeddedChat` and running:

```bash
yarn
```

#### Build Packages

After installing dependencies, build the packages (`auth`, `api`, and `react`) by running the following command in the root directory:

```bash
yarn build
```

#### Starting Storybook for React

Navigate to the `react` package directory and start Storybook with the following commands:

```bash
cd packages/react
yarn storybook
```

Storybook should now be operational. Experiment with `EmbeddedChat` and its components, observing real-time changes in Storybook.

### Custom Rocket Chat Server Configuration

By default, Storybook connects to `http://localhost:3000`. To use a different Rocket Chat server:

Create a `.env` file in the `packages/react` directory.

Set the `STORYBOOK_RC_HOST` variable:

```bash
STORYBOOK_RC_HOST=<your-custom-url>
```

Alternatively, run this command in the `packages/react` directory:

```bash
STORYBOOK_RC_HOST=<your-custom-url> yarn storybook
```

### Package Development Overview

The project uses a monorepo structure with three key packages: `react`, `auth`, and `api`. Each package fulfills a vital role in the application:

#### React Package Development

The `react` package serves as the main frontend component, having all UI elements and views. It interfaces with the `auth` and `api` packages to manage interactions with the Rocket.Chat server, including API calls and authentication.

To develop and test changes in the `react` package:

1. Navigate to the directory of the `react` package:

```bash
cd packages/react
```

2. Start Storybook to view live changes:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

#### Auth Package Development

To develop and test changes in the `auth` package:

1. Navigate to the `auth` package directory:

   ```bash
   cd packages/auth
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

#### API Package Development

For development in the `api` package:

1. Navigate to the `api` package directory:

   ```bash
   cd packages/api
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

**Development Workflow Notes:**

- The `react` package relies on the `api` package. After making changes to the `api`, rebuild it using `yarn build` in `packages/api`, and then restart the React project.

- Similarly, the `api` package depends on the `auth` package. After making changes to `auth`, rebuild it using `yarn build` in `packages/auth`, and then restart the `api` development environment.

This structured approach facilitates cohesive development and integration across all components of the application.

### Conclusion

This environment offers a complete setup for developing and testing the `EmbeddedChat` component, alongside its `api` and `auth` packages. Feel free to explore and enhance the capabilities of `EmbeddedChat`!
