# EmbeddedChat

An easy to use full-stack component (ReactJS + backend behaviors) embedding Rocket.Chat into your webapp.

_EmbeddedChat is a full-stack React component node module of the RocketChat application that is fully configurable, extensible, and flexible for use. It is tightly bound with the RocketChat server using Rocket.Chat nodejs SDK and its UI using RocketChat's Fuselage Design System._

## Development

### Local Setup
To run the embeddedchat, you will need a *Rocket.Chat* server running (development or production). To setup Rocket.Chat dev environment follow this guide.
[https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat#%EF%B8%8F-local-development](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat#%EF%B8%8F-local-development)

#### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js version 16.19.0 installed. We recommend using [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage your Node.js versions.

To use the correct Node.js version for this project, run the following command:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
``` 

We use yarn workspaces. Install yarn if not already installed.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

Thats all, This will install all the dependencies and will then build our auth, api and react package.

#### Starting storybook for react
```bash
cd packages/react
yarn storybook
```
Till now, storybook should be up and running. You can play around with EmbeddedChat and it's component and see changes in storybook in real-time.
 
### Working with api and auth packages.
#### Starting auth dev environment
If you want to make changes to auth package and test them, you can start its playground server.
```bash
cd packages/auth
yarn dev
```
React package depends on api package. If you make any change to api package, build the package using `yarn build` in `package/api` directory. Then, restart the react projects.

#### Starting api dev environment
If you want to make changes to api package and test them, you can start its playground server.
```bash
cd packages/api
yarn dev
```
Api package depends on auth package. If you make any change to auth package, build the package using `yarn build` in `package/auth` directory. Then, restart the api dev environment.
